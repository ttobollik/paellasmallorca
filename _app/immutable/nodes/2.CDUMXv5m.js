Guille, born in 1968 in Palma de Mallorca, is an adventurous soul who cherishes nature and animals. After a bustling city life, he now enjoys a peaceful countryside retirement, engaging in carpentry, tending to the garden, and hosting delightful local meals. As for me, Patri, at 28 years old, I inherited his love for cooking and discovered my joy in sharing it with others. As a child, Sundays were extra special—a day reserved for our cherished family paella tradition. It was my favorite day, a time when we all came together, sharing the joy of simple life pleasures. Whether cooking, setting the table, or caring for our animals, paella was the heart that brought us closer. Those cherished memories inspired us to create "Paella Experience at Ca Tothom."– a heartfelt blend of nature, people, and the art of cooking. With warm embraces, we invite you to join our journey and savor the delightful treats we've prepared for you.`,image:"images/1.jpeg"},{title:"What We Do",description:"Join us for an authentic Paella Experience – a day of nature, delicious food, and fun. We'll begin with a  village walk, taking in stunning views and discovering local stories. Next, we'll gather at my dad's house. We'll have some drinks and local snacks at the porche sorrounded by my lovely chickens and green wiews before we get hands on. Cooking paella has always been a cherished family tradition, where everyone gathers around the pan to savor life's simple pleasures. Through this experience, I'll guide you through each step to help you master the art of creating the perfect paella. After relishing our satisfying lunch, we'll treat ourselves to delightful desserts and coffee to conclude our memorable day. Our goal is to foster the same sense of togetherness that paella effortlessly creates. Through this culinary journey, we aim to not only celebrate the flavors of Spain but also the bonds between families, friends, and new acquaintances who join us.",image:"images/2.jpeg"},{title:"Where We Are",description:"Our experience takes place in Banyalbufar, a picturesque village located in Mallorca's Serra de Tramuntana, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This magical spot perfectly combines sea and mountains, offering breathtaking landscapes. Banyalbufar is renowned for its iconic terraces, built during the Arab era, which shape the landscape and tell stories of centuries past. Our house, nestled in this stunning setting, has been a part of my family’s story since my parents bought it when I was four years old. What started as a weekend holiday retreat became much more when my father decided to move here full-time 13 years ago, drawn by the tranquility and beauty of the land. The experience takes place outdoors, in the heart of our garden, on the porch, and in our open-air kitchen. Surrounded by nature, the fresh air and the sounds of the countryside make it even more special. We share this space with our beloved animals—cats and chickens—that bring life and charm to our home. This isn’t just a destination; it’s a cherished corner of the island where nature, tradition, and family memories come together to create something truly unique.",image:"images/3.jpeg"}];var Oe=H('<div class="w-full md:w-1/3"><!></div>'),He=H('<div class="flex justify-center my-4"><img alt="Paella Experience Logo" class="h-48"></div> <div class="flex flex-wrap items-start w-full"></div>',1);function Ue(r,e){_e(e,!1);const a=!0;var s=He(),f=xe(s),o=E(f);O(o,"src",`${F??""}/images/LogoFullLg.png`),x(f);var l=M(f,2);return Ie(l,5,()=>De,Ae,(v,h)=>{var u=Oe(),t=E(u);Me(t,Ee(()=>D(h))),x(u),j(v,u)}),x(l),j(r,s),Ne(e,"prerender",a),ke({prerender:a})}export{Ue as component};
