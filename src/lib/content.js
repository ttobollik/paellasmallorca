    description: "We are Guille and Patri – a father-daughter team with a shared passion for cooking and genuine hospitality. Guille, born in 1968 in Palma de Mallorca, is an adventurous soul who cherishes nature and animals. After a bustling city life, he now enjoys a peaceful countryside retirement, engaging in carpentry, tending to the garden, and hosting delightful local meals. As for me, Patri, at 28 years old, I inherited his love for cooking and discovered my joy in sharing it with others. " +
    "As a child, Sundays were extra special—a day reserved for our cherished family paella tradition. It was my favorite day, a time when we all came together, sharing the joy of simple life pleasures. Whether cooking, setting the table, or caring for our animals, paella was the heart that brought us closer. " +
    "Those cherished memories inspired us to create \"Paella Experience at Ca Tothom.\"" +
    "– a heartfelt blend of nature, people, and the art of cooking. With warm embraces, we invite you to join our journey and savor the delightful treats we've prepared for you.",

    "This magical spot perfectly combines sea and mountains, offering breathtaking landscapes. " +
    "Banyalbufar is renowned for its iconic terraces, built during the Arab era, which shape the landscape and tell stories of centuries past. Our house, nestled in this stunning setting, has been a part of my family’s story since my parents bought it when I was four years old. " + 
    "What started as a weekend holiday retreat became much more when my father decided to move here full-time 13 years ago, drawn by the tranquility and beauty of the land. " + 
    "The experience takes place outdoors, in the heart of our garden, on the porch, and in our open-air kitchen. Surrounded by nature, the fresh air and the sounds of the countryside make it even more special. We share this space with our beloved animals—cats and chickens—that bring life and charm to our home. This isn’t just a destination; it’s a cherished corner of the island where nature, tradition, and family memories come together to create something truly unique.",
